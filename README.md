# Uber-Data-Analysis

This project analyzes Uber ride data using Python to extract meaningful insights on ride patterns, distance trends, peak times, and user behavior. The project demonstrates the application of data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using real-world data.

**Objectives**

Clean and preprocess raw Uber ride data.

Analyze ride frequency across days, months, and hours.

Examine trip distances and purpose distributions.

Identify peak travel times and popular travel purposes.

Visualize findings for clear interpretation.


**Key Steps**

 Imported and explored the Uber dataset.
 
 Cleaned missing values and transformed time columns for analysis.
 
 Extracted features such as day, month, and hour for time-based analysis.
 
 
**Outcome**

The project strengthened EDA, data cleaning, and visualization skills, while enhancing the ability to extract insights from real-world datasets for business decision-making.
